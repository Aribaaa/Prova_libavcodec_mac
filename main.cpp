    /*
    First, we lock the overlay because we are going to be writing to it. This is a good habit to get
    into so you don't have problems later.
    The AVPicture struct, as shown before, has a data pointer that is an array of 4 pointers. Since
    we are dealing with YUV420P here, we only have 3 channels,
    and therefore only 3 sets of data. Other formats might have a fourth pointer for an alpha channel
    or something. linesize is what it sounds like.
    The analogous structures in our YUV overlay are the pixels and pitches variables. ("pitches" is
    the term SDL uses to refer to the width of a given line of data.)
    So what we do is point the three arrays of pict.data at our overlay, so when we write to pict,
    we're actually writing into our overlay,
    which of course already has the necessary space allocated. Similarly, we get the linesize
    information directly from our overlay.
    We change the conversion format to PIX_FMT_YUV420P, and we use img_convert just like before.

    DRAWING THE IMAGE

    But we still need to tell SDL to actually show the data we've given it. We also pass this function
    a rectangle that says where the movie should go
    and what width and height it should be scaled to. This way, SDL does the scaling for us, and it
    can be assisted by your graphics processor for faster scaling
    Now our video is displayed!

    Let's take this time to show you another feature of SDL: its event system. SDL is set up so that
    when you type, or move the mouse in the SDL application,
    or send it a signal, it generates an event. Your program then checks for these events if it wants
    to handle user input. Your program can also make up events
    to send the SDL event system. This is especially useful when multithread programming with SDL,
    which we'll see in Tutorial 4. In our program,
    we're going to poll for events right after we finish processing a packet. For now, we're just
    going to handle the SDL_QUIT event so we can exit
    */

    default:
        break;
    }

    /*
    AUDIO

    So now we want to play sound. SDL also gives us methods for outputting sound.
    The SDL_OpenAudio() function is used to open the audio device itself.
    It takes as arguments an SDL_AudioSpec struct, which contains all the information
    about the audio we are going to output.

    Before we show how you set this up, let's explain first about how audio is handled
    by computers. Digital audio consists of a long stream of samples. Each sample
    represents a value of the audio waveform. Sounds are recorded at a certain sample
    rate, which simply says how fast to play each sample, and is measured in number of
    samples per second. Example sample rates are 22,050 and 44,100 samples per second,
    which are the rates used for radio and CD respectively. In addition, most audio can
    have more than one channel for stereo or surround, so for example, if the sample is in stereo,
    the samples will come 2 at a time. When we get data from a movie file, we don't know how many
    samples we will get, but ffmpeg will not give us partial samples - that also means that it will
    not split a stereo sample up, either.

    SDL's method for playing audio is this: you set up your audio options: the sample rate
    (called "freq" for frequency in the SDL struct), number of channels, and so forth, and we
    also set a callback function and userdata. When we begin playing audio, SDL will continually
    call this callback function and ask it to fill the audio buffer with a certain number of bytes.
    After we put this information in the SDL_AudioSpec struct, we call SDL_OpenAudio(), which
    will open the audio device and give us back another AudioSpec struct. These are the specs we
    will actually be using â€” we are not guaranteed to get what we asked for!
    SETTING UP THE AUDIO

    Keep that all in your head for the moment, because we don't actually have any information
    yet about the audio streams yet! Let's go back to the place in our code where we found the
    video stream and find which stream is the audio stream.
